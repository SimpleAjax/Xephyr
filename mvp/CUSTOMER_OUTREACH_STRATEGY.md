## Outreach Templates & Scripts

### Cold LinkedIn Connection Request

**Version 1: Direct Value**
```
Hi [Name], 

Saw you're leading engineering at [Company]. I'm building an AI tool 
that catches project risks before they become delays - think "health 
score" for your projects.

Would love 10 minutes of your feedback on whether this would actually 
solve problems you face. No pitch, just learning.

[Your name]
```

**Version 2: Common Connection**
```
Hi [Name], 

We both know [Mutual Connection] / both part of [Group]. 

I'm working on something to help engineering managers spot team 
overloads early. Given your role at [Company], I'd value your 
perspective.

Mind if I share a quick mockup for feedback?
```

---

### Cold Email Template

**Subject: 2 min feedback? (Project health monitoring concept)**

```
Hi [Name],

I'm building an AI-powered project health system that proactively 
flags risks like team overloads, deadline conflicts, and skill gaps 
- before they derail projects.

Current tools only show you what's already broken. I'm trying to 
build something that warns you 2 weeks early.

I have interactive mockups ready and would love 10-15 minutes of 
your brutal honest feedback. Not selling anything - just validating 
the concept with people who actually manage projects.

Worth a brief conversation?

[Calendar Link] or reply with a time that works.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. - If this isn't relevant, feel free to ignore. Appreciate your time either way.
```

---

### Warm Introduction Request

```
Hey [Friend's Name],

I'm building an AI project health monitoring tool and looking for 
feedback from engineering leaders. You mentioned knowing [Target Name] 
at [Company] - do you think they'd be open to a 10-minute chat about 
project management pain points?

Happy to return the favor however I can.

Thanks!
[Your name]
```

---

### Twitter/X DM Template

```
Hey [Name], 

Saw your tweet about [project management pain point]. I'm building 
something to address exactly that - an AI system that flags risks 
before they become fires.

Have mockups ready. Worth 10 mins for feedback? No pitch, just learning.
```

---

## The UI Mockup Pitch Strategy

### The "Mockup-First" Approach

When you only have UI mockups, position it as **intentional** rather than incomplete:

> "Before writing a single line of backend code, I want to validate that 
> the user experience actually solves real problems. These mockups represent 
> my hypothesis - your feedback will determine what gets built."

### Psychology of Mockup Pitches

| Approach | Why It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| **"You're the expert"** | People love giving opinions; disarms sales resistance |
| **"Help me not waste time"** | Creates reciprocity; they feel invested |
| **"Early access"** | Scarcity principle; they'll be "first to know" |
| **"Brutal honesty"** | Signals you're not desperate; invites real criticism |

### The Pitch Structure (5 Minutes)

```
1. CONTEXT (30 sec)
   "I managed dev teams for X years. The problem was always discovering 
    issues too late - in standups instead of before they happen."

2. THE SHIFT (30 sec)
   "Current tools are reactive. I want to build something predictive - 
    like a health score that warns you 2 weeks before disaster."

3. MOCKUP WALKTHROUGH (3 min)
   [Walk through 3 key screens - see Demo Script below]

4. THE ASK (1 min)
   "What would make you actually pay for this? What's missing? 
    What's overkill?"

5. NEXT STEPS (30 sec)
   "Can I keep you in the loop? I'll share the beta when ready."
```

## Demo Script for Mockup Walkthrough

### Screen 1: Dashboard Overview

**What to Show:**
- Portfolio view with multiple projects
- Health scores (color-coded: green/yellow/red)
- Quick stats: completion %, team load, upcoming deadlines

**What to Say:**
> "This is your morning briefing. Instead of checking 5 different tools, 
> you see everything that needs attention. Red means act today, yellow 
> means watch closely, green means on track."

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Is this the first thing you'd want to see?"
- "What number is missing here that you'd look for?"
- "Would you trust this health score or verify it manually?"

---

### Screen 2: Project Health Detail

**What to Show:**
- Breakdown of health factors (schedule, resources, dependencies)
- Risk indicators with explanations
- Team workload visualization

**What to Say:**
> "When you click into a project, you see WHY the health score is what 
> it is. This project is yellow because Emma is at 125% capacity and 
> there's a skill gap on the critical path task."

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Is this level of detail useful or overwhelming?"
- "Would you share this view with stakeholders?"
- "What action would you take from this screen?"

---

### Screen 3: Nudges / Alerts

**What to Show:**
- AI-generated alerts list
- Severity levels (critical/medium/low)
- One-click actions

**What to Say:**
> "These are proactive nudges. Instead of you digging through data, 
> the system surfaces what needs your attention. 'Sarah's workload 
> spiked' or 'This task is blocking 3 others.'"

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How many alerts per day is too many?"
- "Would you want to configure these or trust AI?"
- "What's a nudge you'd want that isn't shown?"

---

### Screen 4: Assignment / Reallocation (if applicable)

**What to Show:**
- Smart assignment suggestions
- Skill matching visualization
- Workload balancing recommendations

**What to Say:**
> "When you need to assign a task, it suggests who has capacity AND 
> the right skills. No more guessing or checking 3 spreadsheets."

**Questions to Ask:**
- "Do you handle assignments or delegate that?"
- "How do you currently decide who gets what?"
- "Would your team trust AI suggestions?"

---

### Screen 5: Scenario Planning (if applicable)

**What to Show:**
- What-if analysis interface
- Impact simulation
- Timeline/cost projections

**What to Say:**
> "Before saying yes to that 'quick feature request,' you can simulate 
> the impact. 'If we add this, what's the delay on existing commitments?'"

**Questions to Ask:**
- "How do you currently evaluate scope changes?"
- "Who asks for these 'quick' additions?"
- "Would this help you push back on requests?"

---

## Objection Handling

### "We already use Jira/Asana/Monday"

**Your Response:**
> "Perfect - we're not replacing those. Think of this as a health 
> monitoring layer ON TOP of what you use. Jira tells you what's 
> happening. This tells you what's ABOUT to go wrong. 
>
> Most teams I talk to love their task tracker but still get surprised 
> by delays. Does that happen to you?"

---

### "This looks complicated"

**Your Response:**
> "Fair feedback - what specifically feels complex? [Listen]
>
> The goal is actually to simplify. Right now you probably check 
> multiple tools and have mental models of team capacity. This should 
> replace that mental overhead with a single health score.
>
> Would a simpler first version be more appealing?"

---

### "We're not big enough for this"

**Your Response:**
> "Interesting - how many projects/people are you managing? [Listen]
>
> I've heard this from 5-person teams and 50-person teams. The pain 
> usually starts around project 3, when you can't hold everything in 
> your head anymore.
>
> What does your current process look like for catching problems early?"

---

### "Call me when it's built"

**Your Response:**
> "Absolutely will. Quick question though - if I build exactly what's 
> shown here, would you actually use it? Or is there something missing 
> that would be a dealbreaker?
>
> I want to make sure I'm building something people want, not just 
> what I think they want."

---

### "I don't have budget"

**Your Response:**
> "Noted - if budget weren't an issue, would this solve problems you 
> have? [If yes] 
>
> What I'm building first is a free tier / beta program. The goal is 
> to prove value before asking for money. Would you be open to trying 
> it free for a month and telling me honestly if it's worth paying for?"

---

## Feedback Collection Framework

### The 5 Questions You Must Ask

1. **Problem Validation**
   > "On a scale of 1-10, how painful is this problem for you right now?"

2. **Solution Fit**
   > "Does this approach feel like it would solve that problem?"

3. **Current Workaround**
   > "How are you handling this today? (Spreadsheets, meetings, intuition?)"

4. **Dealbreaker Features**
   > "What's the ONE feature that, if missing, would make this a hard no?"

5. **Price Sensitivity**
   > "If this worked perfectly, what would it be worth per month? (Don't worry, I won't hold you to it)"

### Recording Feedback

Create a simple spreadsheet:

| Date | Name | Company | Role | Problem Score | Would Use? | Key Feedback | Follow-up |
|------|------|---------|------|---------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| 2/23 | John | Acme | EM | 8/10 | Yes | Needs GitHub integration | Beta list |
| 2/24 | Sarah | TechCo | PM | 5/10 | Maybe | Too complex for small team | Revisit at 50+ people |

### Pattern Recognition

After 10-20 conversations, look for:
- **Common requests** (build these first)
- **Common objections** (address in pitch)
- **Role differences** (EMs care about X, PMs care about Y)
- **Company size patterns** (too early/too late for certain features)

## Final Advice

### Do's
- ✅ Lead with their problem, not your solution
- ✅ Take detailed notes immediately after each call
- ✅ Follow up within 24 hours with a thank you
- ✅ Actually incorporate feedback into mockups
- ✅ Be genuinely curious, not pitchy
- ✅ Ask for referrals: "Who else should I talk to about this?"

### Don'ts
- ❌ Defend your mockups when criticized
- ❌ Talk more than you listen (aim for 30% you, 70% them)
- ❌ Ask leading questions ("You'd find this useful, right?")
- ❌ Ignore negative feedback hoping for better responses
- ❌ Chase people who aren't responding (move on)
- ❌ Build features just because one person asked

### Mindset
> "You're not selling. You're learning. Every 'no' teaches you something 
> that could save you months of building the wrong thing."
